# Data607_ImageClassification_11Models

11 different algorithms trained with garbage image data to classify them into "trash", "recyclable", "compostable". 
Jupyter Notebook designed to work on GoogleColab in order to use GPU runtime. To train XGBoost and CNN faster, GPU usage is critical. 
Dataset is from a open licensed Kaggle Dataset. You'll need Kaggle API token to download directly from Kaggle. 
Each trained model object saved and downloaded. 

Codes to make image based predictions will be uploaded later.
